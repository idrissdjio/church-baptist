Do NOT make any push request like: git push origin

I will be making a couple of new updates on the github repo regularly, so whenever you want to start working, make sure to check if you have the updated version of the github repo. You can do by doing:
- git remote update
- git status
- To fetch latest change if you are not updated: git fetch origin


Whenever you are done with the code update, test it locally, make sure it doesn't break any other parts of the code. Follow these steps to pull your changes to the repo:
-  Create new branch: git checkout -b branch_name
- Add only the files you added with: git add file1.js file2.js file3.js
- commit changes: git commit -m “description of the changes”
- make push request: git push origin branch_name
