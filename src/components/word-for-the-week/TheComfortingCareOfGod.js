      <h2>The Comforting Care of God</h2>
      <p>Isaiah 66:13 “As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you;”</p>
      <p>It’s amazing when a young child gets hurt, no matter how loving their dad is, they always want mummy. She seems to make everything better. Her comfort brings a calm unlike anything else. She can sympathise as she feels every sob of her child. Mums can just understand their children in a way that nobody else can.</p>
      <p>It’s like when Thomas Edison, America's greatest inventor, was a young lad his teacher sent him home with a note which said, “Your child is dumb. We can’t do anything for him.” Mrs. Edison wrote back, “You do not understand my boy. I will teach him myself.” And she did, with results that are well known.</p>
      <p>In this verse, the prophet Isaiah, under the inspiration of God, borrows that analogy and tenderly applies it to God. We so often think of God as harsh and stern and firm and only existing to exercise wrath and judgement. However, our God is a tender, loving Father. He is compassionate and can sympathise with us in a way nobody else can, not even our mother.</p>
      <p>The word “comforteth” here is born from the root word “to sigh”. Applying that to this verse, we could say “As a mother who sighs with her child, so I sigh with you”. Just as a mother feels our pains, sighs when we sigh, sobs when we sob, God in a much greater way does the same. God feels for us in our trials.</p>
      <p>Concerning Israel, when they were in bondage in Egypt, we read “and the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;” (Exodus 3:7)</p>
      <p>There is not a tear we cry, nor a trouble we experience, nor a frustration we feel, that God doesn’t know and understand. His heart is moved with compassion as He comes to comfort us. In our times of sorrow “He is nigh unto the brokenhearted.” In our times of stress “He knows our frame” in our times of suffering “His grace is sufficient”.</p>
      <p>As you think of your mother, and all the tender care and comfort she gave and gives - you remember your God - who comforts in a much greater way.</p>
      <p>God Bless you this week.</p>
      <p>
        “When tears are falling, and mind is sad;<br/>
        When life seems robbed of the bliss it had;<br/>
        When heart feels empty, bereft, and lone;<br/>
        When treasured joys are no longer known;<br/>
        It is then, it is then He will draw so near<br/>
        To comfort, and strengthen, and soothe, and cheer!<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        He knows the anguish, the grief, the pain!<br/>
        He understandeth the tears that rain!<br/>
        The heart’s deep hunger — its loneliness:<br/>
        The love so craving the fond caress!<br/>
        It is then, it is then that He will draw near<br/>
        To lovingly, tenderly dry each tear.<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        Will He come as King — with a great array —<br/>
        With sovereign splendour and grand display?<br/>
        He comes not thus when He comes to bless<br/>
        His dear one in broken-heartedness!<br/>
        Ah, no — as a mother – the best, most dear —<br/>
        To soothe and to comfort will he dare near!”<br/>
      </p>
