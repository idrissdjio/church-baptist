      <h2>Where is God?</h2>
      <p>Matthew 1:23 “Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call His name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.”</p>
      <p>In times like these, we can be tempted to ask the question, “Where is God?”</p>
      <p>Where is God in my suffering? Where is God in my struggles? Where is God in my stresses? We can feel that God has abandoned us. That God is distant. That God is silent.</p>
      <p>The Psalmist David often felt like that. In Psalm 13:1 he cried “How long wilt thou forget me, O LORD? for ever? How long wilt thou hide thy face from me?”</p>
      <p>However our text in Matthew 1 provides a comforting cure for such feelings. Israel had experienced 400 years of silence from God. Perhaps many then were wondering, where is God? Suddenly, a humble, Jewish, virgin maid falls pregnant. Left bewildered her fiancé Joseph begins contemplating divorce, perhaps wondering ‘where is God?’</p>
      <p>Then, right on time, God shows up, sending His Angel with a message, specifically for Joseph. There was no need to fear. This baby was the Son of God. This was the Messiah. This was all part of God’s redemptive plan.</p>
      <p>Further reassurance actually arrives in the form of the names that the Messiah was to be given. He would be called “Jesus” for He would be the Saviour of the world.</p>
      <p>But He would also be called “Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.” This Messiah who would be born would break the silence and God would literally, physically and bodily be with His people in that day.</p>
      <p>Fast forward 2000 years, while Jesus has returned to Heaven, His name has not changed. He is still Emmanuel. The comfort of every Christian is that while Jesus is no longer WITH US physically, He is WITHIN US spiritually. We have been given the indwelling Holy Spirit of God. In fact this is the truth that the Lord used to calm the troubled hearts of His disciples, who feared they’d be left alone in this world:</p>
      <p>John 14:16-18 “And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.”</p>
      <p>This means that not only is God with us, but God is actually within us. This means that no matter how isolated or alone we feel, we are never on our own. Jesus is ALWAYS with us, because He is WITHIN us. He dwells in our hearts by faith. No matter where we go, or what we are going through Jesus is with us. With us in our worries and fears. With us on our sick bed. With us in our work place. With us at home in our isolation. Being with us, Jesus gives us His sustaining strength and sufficient grace to face each day.</p>
      <p>So, the next time the devil begins to whisper, or you begin to wonder, ‘where is God’, you just whisper back, He is with and within me, because He is Emmanuel.</p>
      <p>God Bless you this week.</p>
