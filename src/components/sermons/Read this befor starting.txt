 Install react-pdf
Install react-pdf to render PDF files. You'll also need pdfjs-dist, which react-pdf relies on:

type the command below in your terminal after navigating to the project's src folder.

npm install @react-pdf/renderer pdfjs-dist

In your project, create a new file for the PDF viewer component, e.g.,
 PDFViewer.js. This component will use react-pdf to display the PDF

Using Your PDF Viewer Component
Now, use the PDFViewer component in your application's main component (e.g., App.js, index.js or
 page you want to display the pdf file ). 
You need to import a PDF file or provide a URL to the PDF you want to display
