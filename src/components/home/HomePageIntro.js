We are now merged as one while keeping the East Side Baptist Church name. As of Resurrection Sunday April 9, 2023 (Easter Sunday), Pastor Methum has taken over Pastoral duties for East Side Baptist Church. Doing so, Pastor Methum is able to keep giving God's Words while simultaneously allowing Pastor Brown to fully retire.</p>
