      <h2 className='text'>Message From Pastor</h2>
      <p>Our journey as a church family has been one of faith, growth, and divine guidance. After seven fruitful years in our first location, where we experienced the joy of a filled auditorium, God led us to our next chapter at 2935 W. Greenfield Avenue. This new chapter involved extensive renovations to create a welcoming space for worship and community, including a new fellowship hall and educational rooms. Our growth continued, prompting us to seek a larger space to accommodate our expanding congregation. In 2009, God guided us to our current home at 3068 S 13th St. Here, we continue our mission, ever reliant on God's provision to complete the work needed for our church to flourish. Our story is one of continual trust in God's plan, reflecting our commitment to serve and grow together as a community in faith.</p>
