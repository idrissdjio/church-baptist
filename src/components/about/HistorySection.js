      <h2>HISTORY</h2>
      <p>During the summer 1987 Baptist Missions sent a team of workers into Saintfield to engage in evangelism with a view to planting a new Association of Baptist Churches in Ireland church. A team of Cecil Johnstone, Stanley Black, Evan Williams, Desmond Creelman, Alan Wilson and Sam Best, with Pastor Jim Henry as leader. The door to door visitation was well received in most homes during the first few weeks and at this time the Baptist Mission team decided to call a meeting of all the people in the area who were interested in the formation of a Baptist church. On 4 June 1987 after notifying all the local Association of Baptist Churches in Ireland churches a meeting was held in Wilfred and Margaret Reid's house to discuss the possibility of establishing a Baptist church in Saintfield and to find out how many local Baptists were interested in the work. Pastor Derek Baxter spoke on the ‘Power of God’ after which those gathered had a time of prayer concentrating on the work in the Saintfield area.</p>

      <p>The Baptist Mission team continued with their visitation in the town and for two weeks from 26 July to 8 August a mission was held in a tent on Listooder Road, in a field granted by Robert McBriar. Pastor Jim Henry was the speaker at the Gospel meetings while Pastor Jim Garrett took the Children’s Meetings each afternoon during the mission. Many people from local churches also helped in the mission by playing the organ, testifying and singing. The meetings were well attended and at the end of the mission five people were known to become Christians and one backslider was restored.</p>
